## What Was Built

A 4-layer AI code review system with multi-IDE support:

| Layer | Purpose | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 0 | Generation Guidelines (prevention) | Auto-loads via `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| 1 | Quick Review (80% use case) | `/layer1-quick-review` |
| 2 | Specialists (5 domains) | Security, Correctness, Maintainability, Performance, Data Integrity |
| 3 | Verification | Confirms fixes work |

---

## Installers Created

| Platform | Script | What It Does |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Claude Code | `install-skills.sh/.ps1` | Skills + auto-load Layer 0 |
| VS Code | `install-vscode.sh/.ps1` | Full-length snippets |
| Visual Studio | `install-visualstudio.ps1` | XML snippets |
| JetBrains | `install-jetbrains.sh/.ps1` | Live Templates |

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Layer 0 auto-loads** in Claude Code via `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - no manual paste needed
2. **Smart merge behavior** - detects existing CLAUDE.md, prompts to append (not overwrite)
3. **Full-length snippets** - IDE snippets contain complete 200-800 line prompts, not condensed versions
4. **Platform differences documented** - README clarifies that Claude Code needs no copy-paste, while IDE snippets still require pasting to AI chat

---

## User's Setup

- Global CLAUDE.md installed at `C:\Users\cdbrown\.claude\CLAUDE.md`
- Layer 0 will auto-load in all future Claude Code sessions
- Skills available via `/layer1-quick-review`, etc.

---

## What's NOT Done (Optional Future Work)

1. `skill-rules.json` for auto-suggestions based on keywords
2. Uninstall scripts
3. Testing on fresh systems (Linux/Mac)

## Files Changed This Session

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | Clarified platform-specific workflows, added comparison table |
| `CONTINUITY_LEDGER.md` | Created with full session history |
| `claude-code/CLAUDE.md.template` | Layer 0 content for auto-load |
| `install-skills.sh/.ps1` | Added CLAUDE.md install with append logic |

---

## To Resume Work

1. Read `CONTINUITY_LEDGER.md` for full context
2. Check `README.md` for current documentation state
3. Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits
